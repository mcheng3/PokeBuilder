WHAT STILL NEEDS TO HAPPEN:

1. Get adding/editing pokemon working
  - javascript doesn't show up
  - doesn't modify database

2. Get editing a team working
  - trying to change the name/version/description of an already-existing team
    throws a database error

3. Get strengths/weaknesses working
  - requires several helper functions and some api work

4. Aesthetic changes
  - make sure all color schemes work
  - make sure everything is readable
  - make sure everything looks nice

5. Video!
  - we'll decide on something when we meet on Tuesday
